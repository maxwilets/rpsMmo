### Technologies Used

     * JavaScript

### Results

     * Instead of rock paper scissors I instead used some fun characters to add some originality and fun to the game: Knight (Rock), Ninja        (Paper), and Mage (Scissors)
     * The chat bar is working
     * Only two players are allowed to play
     * Logs each players guess and shows the result of the game
     * The game page is dynamically created
     
### Improvements

     Some things that could be done to improve the game:
     
     * There are a few errors in the chat section of the app where it sometimes double texts
     * Better front end design on the app
     * Be able to track players scored of one of them leaves the game
